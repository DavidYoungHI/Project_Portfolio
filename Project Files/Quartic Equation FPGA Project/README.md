## Project Objective:
To design and implement a digital circuit in VHDL to compute and display
the four roots of a quartic equation on an FPGA, utilizing time-multiplexed
7-segment displays and the Xilinx Vivado environment.

The "Sim" folder contains the simulation result and timing summary. <br>
The "bit" folder contains the project's bit file. <br>
The "Constraints" folder contains the contraints of the project. <br>
The "src" folder contains the vhd code. <br>
The "EntireProject.zip" folder is the project folder generated from the Xilinx environment which contains all of the files for the project.
