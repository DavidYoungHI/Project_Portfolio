## Project Objective:
To design and implement a digital circuit in VHDL to compute and display
the four roots of a quartic equation on an FPGA, utilizing time-multiplexed
7-segment displays and the Xilinx Vivado environment.

The "Sim" folder contains the simulation result and timing summary. 
The "bit" folder contains the project's bit file. 
The "Constraints" folder contains the contraints of the project. 
The "src" folder contains the vhd code. 
The "EntireProject.zip" folder is the project folder generated from the Xilinx environment which contains all of the files for the project.
