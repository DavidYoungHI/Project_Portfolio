## Instruction Cache Project
Contains .txt files of the instruction cache ("icache.txt"), a simulated main memory ("memcontents.txt"), the testbench used to verify my design, and a file containing the addresses used in my testbench ("testaddresses.txt"). <br>
The testbench code is included in the first section of the "icache.txt" file.
