### Featured Projects
1. **Analog IC Neural Amplifier (Cadence Virtuoso)**
    Designed and simulated a low-noise MOSFET neural amplifier for biomedical signal acquisition. Achieved >40 dB gain, sub-0.1 Hz low-frequency cutoff, and stable     phase margin while analyzing tradeoffs between power consumption, bandwidth, and noise performance.

9. **RF Low-Pass Filters (ADS – Lumped & Microstrip)**
   Designed a 4th-order 0.5 dB ripple Chebyshev low-pass filter with a 3 GHz cutoff using lumped elements, microstrip shunt stubs, and stepped-impedance lines.        Compared schematic and EM simulations to evaluate parasitics, insertion loss, and distributed RF effects.
   
8. **RF Quadrature Couplers (ADS – Branch-Line & Rat-Race)**
   Designed and simulated a 3 dB branch-line coupler at 2 GHz and a 6 dB rat-race coupler at 3 GHz using transmission-line and microstrip implementations. Verified    magnitude, isolation, and phase behavior through schematic and Momentum EM simulations.
   
7. **SDES Digital IC Design (Cadence Virtuoso)**
   Designed, laid out, and simulated a CMOS-based digital chip implementing the Simplified DES encryption algorithm. Verified timing using transient simulation and    met layout constraints of 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm.
   
6. **Greenhouse Irrigation System (ESP32 + Raspberry Pi)**
   Developed a wireless, multi-plant irrigation system using ESP32 moisture sensors and a Raspberry Pi controller. Achieved closed-loop control with 80% target        moisture and groundwork for GUI-based remote access.

5. **3D Drone Control System (MATLAB + Simulink)**
   Designed cascaded controllers for vertical, roll, pitch, and yaw motion using a linearized drone model. Verified controllability and tuned gains based on           sampling bandwidths. Simulated and validated system via step responses in Simulink.
   
4. **Instruction Cache Implementation (SystemVerilog)**  
   Designed a direct-mapped instruction cache for a RISC-V processor using SystemVerilog, verified via testbench simulations.
   
3. **Insulin Pump Controller (MATLAB)**  
   Developed a state-feedback and observer-based control system for regulating blood glucose levels with minimal overshoot.

2. **Least-Square Image Classifier (MATLAB)**  
   Created a model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving a 1.94% error rate with 5000 training images.

1. **Quartic Equation Solver on FPGA (VHDL)**  
   Implemented a digital circuit to compute and display roots of a quartic equation on a 7-segment FPGA display.
