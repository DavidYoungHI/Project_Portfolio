- **[Resume PDF](https://github.com/DavidYoungHI/Project_Portfolio/blob/main/David%20Young%20Resume%2002.01.25.pdf)**: My professional resume outlining my education, technical skills, and work experience.
- **Supporting Files**: Code, reports, diagrams, and other materials relevant to the projects mentioned in the portfolio.

### Featured Projects
1. **SDES Digital IC Design (Cadence Virtuoso)**
   Designed, laid out, and simulated a CMOS-based digital chip implementing the Simplified DES encryption algorithm. Verified timing using transient simulation and met layout constraints of 1.5â€¯mm Ã— 1.5â€¯mm.
   
3. **Greenhouse Irrigation System (ESP32 + Raspberry Pi)**
   Developed a wireless, multi-plant irrigation system using ESP32 moisture sensors and a Raspberry Pi controller. Achieved closed-loop control with 80% target moisture and groundwork for GUI-based remote access.

4. **3D Drone Control System (MATLAB + Simulink)**
   Designed cascaded controllers for vertical, roll, pitch, and yaw motion using a linearized drone model. Verified controllability and tuned gains based on sampling bandwidths. Simulated and validated system via step responses in Simulink.
   
5. **Instruction Cache Implementation (SystemVerilog)**  
   Designed a direct-mapped instruction cache for a RISC-V processor using SystemVerilog, verified via testbench simulations.
   
6. **Insulin Pump Controller (MATLAB)**  
   Developed a state-feedback and observer-based control system for regulating blood glucose levels with minimal overshoot.

7. **Least-Square Image Classifier (MATLAB)**  
   Created a model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving a 1.94% error rate with 5000 training images.

8. **Quartic Equation Solver on FPGA (VHDL)**  
   Implemented a digital circuit to compute and display roots of a quartic equation on a 7-segment FPGA display.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: MATLAB (and Simulink), VHDL, SystemVerilog, Python
