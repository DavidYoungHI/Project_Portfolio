# David Young's Project Portfolio ðŸ“‚

Welcome to my project portfolio repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my academic and professional projects, highlighting my experience and passion for analog and digital circuit design, embedded systems, and control systems. 

## About This Repository
This repository includes:
- **Project Portfolio PDF**: A comprehensive document summarizing the projects I have worked on, including objectives, processes, and outcomes.
- **Supporting Files**: Code, reports, diagrams, and other materials relevant to the projects mentioned in the portfolio.

### Featured Projects
1. **Instruction Cache Implementation (SystemVerilog)**  
   Designed a direct-mapped instruction cache for a RISC-V processor using SystemVerilog, verified via testbench simulations.
   
2. **Insulin Pump Controller (MATLAB)**  
   Developed a state-feedback and observer-based control system for regulating blood glucose levels with minimal overshoot.

3. **Least-Square Image Classifier (MATLAB)**  
   Created a model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving a 1.94% error rate with 5000 training images.

4. **Quartic Equation Solver on FPGA (VHDL)**  
   Implemented a digital circuit to compute and display roots of a quartic equation on a 7-segment FPGA display.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: MATLAB, VHDL, SystemVerilog, Python
- **Platforms**: Intel Quartus Prime, Xilinx Vivado, Simulink
- **Other Tools**: PSpice, Bluebeam, SolidWorks
